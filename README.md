1. What is the difference between Tuples and ValueTuples?

Tuples and ValueTuples both allow grouping multiple values into a single object. Tuples are reference types, while ValueTuples are value types. Tuples can have any number of elements and allow naming individual elements, whereas ValueTuples have a limit of eight elements and use a fixed naming convention.

2. What is the difference between is and as keywords?

The is keyword is used for type checking, while the as keyword is used for type casting.

    is checks whether an object is of a certain type.
    as attempts to cast an object to a specified type and returns null if the cast is not successful.

3. What is the use of the "using" keyword?

The using keyword has two purposes:

    Resource Management: It ensures proper disposal of resources by automatically calling the Dispose() method when the scope is exited.
    Namespace Import: It simplifies the usage of types within a specific namespace.

4. What are anonymous types?

Anonymous types allow creating objects without explicitly defining a named type. They are useful for temporary or one-time object structures and are defined using the new keyword and object initializer syntax.

5. What is the purpose of the "dynamic" keyword?

The dynamic keyword enables late binding and dynamic resolution of member invocations. It allows calling methods, properties, and fields on an object without compile-time type checking. The actual type of the object is determined at runtime.

6. What are expression-bodied members?

Expression-bodied members provide a concise syntax for defining members in classes or structs. They allow writing methods, properties, and indexers as single-line expressions instead of full method bodies.

7. What are Funcs and lambda expressions?

Funcs are delegate types that represent functions with specific input and output types. They provide a way to define and pass around methods as parameters or variables. Lambda expressions are anonymous functions that can be used to create instances of Funcs or other delegate types in a more compact and expressive way.

8. What are delegates?

Delegates are types that define a method signature and can hold references to methods with compatible signatures. They are often used for event handling, callback mechanisms, or implementing the observer pattern.

9. How does the Garbage Collector decide which objects can be removed from memory?

The Garbage Collector (GC) in .NET determines object eligibility for garbage collection by analyzing their reachability. Objects that are no longer reachable from the root of the object graph (i.e., not referenced by any active objects or rooted references) are considered eligible for garbage collection and will be reclaimed in subsequent GC cycles.

10. What are generations?

In the context of the .NET Garbage Collector, generations represent different levels of object longevity. Objects are initially allocated in Generation 0, and if they survive garbage collections, they can be promoted to higher generations (1 or 2) based on their longevity. The GC performs more frequent collections on Generation 0, making it a short-lived objects area, while higher generations contain objects with longer lifetimes.
